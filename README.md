# KCG Kosher Cafe Guide
The website I have designed and created to enable Jews (and other people wanting to keep kosher) to find Cafes, restaurants and other dine-in locations that are at or above their level of Kashrut. 
Users of the website and App will be able to set which level of Kashrut they keep when searching for somewhere to eat, and all the results will be that level or higher. 
A photo of the Kashrut certificate and name of the Kashrut Authority issuing it will also be displayed
